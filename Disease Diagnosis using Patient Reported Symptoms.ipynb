    "## **`1.1 Background`**\n",
    "Medical errors can lead to a consequential number of deaths, which can have great repercussions on public health and patient safety. A study reported by Gabriel *et al*. (2024), revealed a high prevalence of medical errors which ranged from 42.8 to 89.8% across various studies in Nigeria. As a case study, in Nigeria, malaria is generally ascribed to all febrile illnesses, and febrile patients regularly exhibit symptoms thought to be caused by malaria or typhoid but which are also commonly observed with other arbovirus infections (Baba *et al*., 2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "Research papers detail the overlapping symptoms of malaria, dengue, yellow fever, and typhoid fever, particularly in febrile patients, leading to common misdiagnosis. For example, malaria symptoms include fever, chills, and headache, while typhoid fever presents with fever, headache, abdominal pain, and constipation. Dengue fever symptoms can involve fever, headache, and joint pain, sometimes progressing to severe bleeding. Yellow fever also starts with sudden high fever and headache, but may involve nausea and vomiting, and can develop into severe forms with high fatality rates. Because these diseases share similar initial symptoms, especially sudden high fever, headache, and body pains, clinical diagnosis is challenging and requires serological or other specific tests to differentiate between them (Moses *et al*., 2016). \n",
    "\n",
    "The misdiagnosis of these highlighted diseases has since become a major concern towards therapeutic administration because of their co-occurrence in many cases and the same location (Okoror *et al*., 2024). Misdiagnosis is a significant problem in the Nigerian and African healthcare system, and the need for dire interventions that proffer solutions to alleviate this challenge is key to drive effective healthcare operations. This challenge drives my team objective to develop a solution that assists doctors in making better-informed diagnostic conclusions, particularly factoring the similarity between the clinical features in this highlighted prevalent diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we leverage technology to develop AI-powered solution with a model designed to effectively predict this disease outcomes based on patient clinical symptoms, and potentially reduce medical errors stemming from misdiagnosis.\n"

    "## **`1.2 Methodology`**\n",
    "The dataset \"**Tabular dataset for AI-based vector-borne disease prediction**\" adopted for this project was published on the 30th December, 2024, by research team from Universite Polytechnique de Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. The dataset was retrieved from the Mendeley Data repository via the Mendeley API, adhering to established guidelines and protocols to ensure data quality and best practices. This multiclass classification project is carried out by Team C-16, and designed to build an AI-powered solution that assists doctors in disease diagnosis. The data information entail: \n",
    "\n",
    "### `Participants`\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset gathers clinical information about patients diagnosed with malaria, dengue, yellow fever, and typhoid fever, as well as patients excluded from these diseases. \n",
    "\n",
    "### `Data Collection`\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected from the health districts of DO and DAFRA, located in the Hauts-Bassins region of Burkina Faso. The dataset includes 300 records. Among the consultations recorded, 150 are from DAFRA and 150 from DO. The data collection lasted for three months, from September to November 2024.The data collection was carried out using a Kobotoolbox form, provided to the doctors. This form was filled out in real-time during consultations in the DO district and based on archives for the DAFRA district. The form was printed on paper because the doctors found this method faster due to the large number of patients to be consulted. For data from the DAFRA district, recording was done in two steps: first during the initial consultation, and then upon the availability of laboratory results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Procedure for Data Processing and Storage`\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was preprocessed, and sensitive information such as name, surname, or place of birth was removed. The original form contained 115 questions, but only 109 were retained. The data includes two CSV files: the first, \"data.csv,\" contains the data, and the second, \"description.xls,\" contains the attribute descriptions. Some attributes are present in the description but not in the data, as they were removed due to lack of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Ethical Approval`\n",
    "\n",
    "To collect the data, authorization was requested from the Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### `Acknowledgement`\n",
    "We duly acknowledge that the dataset was published by Issouf Ouedraogo research team, from the Universite Polytechnique de Bobo-Dioulasso, and we obtained the data from the Mendely data repository, an open source platform for researchers, which is free to share and adapt, following established guidelines as stipulated.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The higher count of missing values at the DO health centre (32) compared to the DAFRA health centre (24) may be attributed to the large patient volume and the use of paper-based documentation, which can increase the likelihood of errors and data loss.\n",
